This repository contains a collection of exercises related to unit operations for automation using DWSim software.

DWSim is a process simulation software that allows users to create and analyze chemical processes. Unit operations are the individual steps that make up a chemical process, such as mixing, separation, and distillation. Automation involves the use of software and hardware to control and optimize these processes.

The exercises in this repository demonstrate how to automate unit operations using DWSim. They include code examples, tutorials, and documentation on how to implement automation strategies using DWSim.

This repository is intended for individuals who are interested in learning how to automate chemical processes using DWSim. It serves as a valuable resource for those looking to improve their understanding of process simulation and automation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, you will need to have DWSim installed on your computer. You can download the software from the official DWSim website.

Once you have DWSim installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine and start working through the exercises.
