# Parallel Processing in Process Simulations  

## Introduction  

Parallel processing is a computational technique that allows multiple tasks or calculations to be executed simultaneously by utilizing multiple CPU cores. This approach significantly improves efficiency and reduces computation time, especially when handling large datasets or complex simulations.  

### Why Use Parallel Processing?  
- **Speed:** Executes multiple tasks concurrently, reducing total processing time.  
- **Efficiency:** Optimally utilizes multi-core processors for better performance.  
- **Scalability:** Easily handles large-scale simulations by distributing workloads.  

### Example Use Case:  
In process simulations, such as **DWSim**, parallel processing can be used to run multiple simulations over different process conditions. For example, instead of running **3,125 simulations sequentially**, leveraging parallel execution with libraries like **Joblib** can **cut computation time by a factor of 3 or more**.  

### Implementation in Python  
Pythonâ€™s `joblib` library enables parallel execution with minimal code modifications:  

```python
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

def run_simulation(params):
    mass_flow, pressure, temperature, delta_q, efficiency = params
    
    # Set parameters
    one.SetMassFlow(mass_flow)
    one.SetPressure(pressure)
    one.SetTemperature(temperature)
    pump_1.set_DeltaQ(delta_q)
    pump_1.set_Eficiencia(efficiency)

    # Run calculation
    Settings.SolverMode = 0
    errors = interf.CalculateFlowsheet2(sim)

results = Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(delayed(run_simulation)(param) for param in param_list)
