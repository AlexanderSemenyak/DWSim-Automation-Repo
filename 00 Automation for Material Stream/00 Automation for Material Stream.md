## Automation of Material Stream

## Objective

To develop a python script to understand how automation will work in DWSim and to get the attributes of materail stream and print it on terminal

To get a range of process data for changing mass flow rate from 1-10 kg/s

## Data

Inlet stream 1:  60 mol % Acetonitrile and 40 mol % of Nitromethane solution flowing at 1 kg/s 

Both the streams are at 348 K and at 1 bar pressure

The liquid streams can be considered as ideal  

## DWSIM Blocks Used

Material Stream

## Thermodynamic Package

Raoultâ€™s law
